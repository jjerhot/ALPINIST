ALPINIST: Axion-Like Particles In Numerous Interactions Simulated and Tabulated
===============================================================================

ALPINIST is a framework used for the simulation of axion-like particle production and decay at beam-dump experiments and the interpretation of the results for the given model.

The framework comprises of several modules each of which reads, processes and writes tabulated data. The modules are used in the order sketched in the following figure.

For using each module, please follow the instructions in the corresponding subdirectory.

Note that this public repository contains only the ALP_rescale module and the necessary tables. For access to the full repository contact one of the authors.
